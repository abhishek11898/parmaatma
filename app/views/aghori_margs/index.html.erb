              The Aghoris are a sect of ascetic Shaivite sadhus who practice a unique and extreme form of Hinduism. They are known for their bizarre and unconventional rituals, such as dwelling in cremation grounds, smearing ashes on their bodies, using human skulls as utensils, and eating flesh from human corpses. They are also devoted to Shiva, the god of destruction and transformation, and seek to attain liberation from the cycle of rebirth by transcending the boundaries of good and evil, purity and impurity, and life and death
